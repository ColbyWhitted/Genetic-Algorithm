# Genetic-Algorithm
By far the most computationaly expensive way to write someone's name.

This is a useless program that I built to give me hands on experience with writing a genetic algorithm. initFunc() takes one string consisting only of letters a-z, and will naturally evolve that string over a series of generations. The longest string I have tested it with is "ColbyJordanWhittedOfPetalumaLikesPizza". The algorithm was able to sucesfully evolve the string without a "Too much recursion" error, in only 110 generations out of 110 thousand lifeforms. Smaller strings like "Colby" are evolved extremely fast usually in less than 10 generations and less than 10 thousand lifeforms.
